# Writing a Plugin

## Terminology

**Service** - Every plugin will be considered as a single service. A plugin should focus on integration with a single thing.

**ServiceAction/Function** - A service can have multiple (related) functions. These functions each do an individual action that can be combined together in a conversational flow to achieve the business objective.
